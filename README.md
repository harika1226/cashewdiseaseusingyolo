Crop disease identification is a critical concern in cashew agriculture, yet it remains a time-
consuming and challenging task. Current methodologies, including neural networks and the K-
means clustering algorithm, demonstrate detection accuracies ranging from 80% to 90%,
underscoring the need for more eﬃcient solutions tailored to cashew crops. This study presents
an innovative approach that harnesses computer vision and machine learning techniques to
streamline the identification of diseases in cashew crops.
Utilizing the YOLO architecture for object detection, our research achieves significant
improvements in eﬃciency and accuracy. YOLO processes high-resolution images of cashew
leaves at a remarkable real-time rate of 45 frames per second, surpassing traditional object
recognition methods. By partitioning the images into grid cells, our algorithm enables a single
neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities with exceptional precision,
specifically targeting diseases prevalent in cashew crops.
The proposed algorithm empowers cashew farmers with the capability to detect diseases in the
early stages of development, enabling timely intervention and eﬀective crop management
practices. Through early diagnosis and intervention, the health and productivity of cashew plants
can be safeguarded, ensuring sustainable cashew production and agricultural livelihoods.
